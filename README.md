# NBA MVP Prediction 

This project aims to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA 2023 season using machine learning algorithms trained on previous season data.

## Introduction

In the NBA, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award is a prestigious honor given to the player judged to be the most valuable to their team during the regular season. This project utilizes machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms, to predict the NBA MVP for the 2023 season based on historical player performance data.
